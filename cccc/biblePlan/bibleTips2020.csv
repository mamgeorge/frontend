tech , WRS , 'Realize reading the bible doesn’t have to done in secret - If you’re a mom with young children, don’t be afraid to pull out your Bible at the breakfast table or while you’re watching the kids play in the backyard. If you’re a young working professional, read Scripture during one of your lunch breaks, or listen to the Bible on the way to work. Bring the Bible into your everyday life, and you just might bless others along the way.'

You have already made significant progress because of your spiritual discipline, and that’s worthy of celebration.'
begn , WRS , 'Evaluate if this commitment is right for you - It’s important for all believers to regularly study and read the Word of God, but how much and how often might vary for different people in different seasons of life.'

prep , PRE , 'Pray – Ask God to give you the motivation and strength to accomplish this goal. You can’t read the Bible like any other book. You need God’s Spirit to help you.'
begn , PRE , 'Pick an easy to read version. ( Note: C4 uses NIV frequently )'
begn , PRE , 'Find a plan – You could simply read three chapters a day and do fine, but I have found having a printed checklist helps keep me disciplined.'
tech , PRE , 'Find a place - Choose the time and place that works best and that you will most likely stick with through the year.'

tech , PRE , 'Catch up when needed – If you miss a day, don’t sweat it… and don’t quit. ( Note: It is better to NOT catch up if that overwhelms you. We ARE saved by grace! )'

prep , PAS , 'Ask yourself why do i read the bible? - If your answer is, “Because I am supposed to”, here’s the real question: “Do you want God?” In other words, do you want to know him more? Do you want to grow in relationship with him, love what he loves, be more deeply anchored in what is most real? Otherwise, it will always leave us dry and dissatisfied. When you read the Scripture because you want to know God more, it changes how you approach your reading. Dont ask: “How will I read the Bible this year?” but “Do I want God?”'
prep , PAS , 'Read the bible from love, not for it - Unless you are sure that you are safe with God, that he loves you, that he is completely committed to you, that he wants your best, you will never seek him.'
prep , PAS , 'Understand the dynamics of your fallen heart	 - Nearly every morning I wake up and my heart has drifted back into it default position of unbelief. It’s embarrassing, really. But, we shouldn’t be surprised about this. Our hearts are like leaky buckets. We need to know this about our hearts. Knowing that my heart is misaligned, to some degree, every morning motivates me to reorient my heart toward God and all that he is for me every morning.'
begn , PAS , 'Raise the sail to catch the wind - Just as a sailor will not catch the wind if he doesn’t raise the sail, we will not grow if we do not raise the sails of our hearts through the means of grace – especially regular bible reading.'
begn , PAS , 'Find a good translation - ( that reads easily for you ) ( Note: C4 uses NIV frequently )'
begn , PAS , 'Find a plan - This is where it is easiest to get lost. You have your Bible open in front of you and think, “Oh, great, now what?” To avoid this moment, you need a plan. It doesn’t really matter what your plan is, provided you have one.'
tech , PAS , 'Find a rhythm - Look at your calendar. Find a consistent block of time. Then, find a quiet spot. Turn your electronics off or leave them somewhere else in the house. Be intentional about making it a focused, non-distracting time. '
tech , PAS , 'Ask God to give you eyes to see - Psalm 119:18 says, “Open our eyes that we may behold wondrous things out of your law.” When you open your Bible, pour out your heart to Him. Tell him you’re tired, distracted, or distant. Tell him your heart needs realignment around what is most real. Then, ask him to open your eyes. '
tech , PAS , 'Stay on the lookout for God as you read - Find a truth to savor for the day. Ask: What does God want me to learn here? What does this tell me about God? Myself? Pastor George Mueller was known for his goal of making his heart happy in God every morning..'
stdy , PAS , 'Slow it down, then write it down - Take a verse, or two, that stood out. Stop. Read through it a number of times. Turn it into a prayer. If you have 20 minutes to read, Spend 10 minutes reading and 10 minutes slowing down on one verse or passage that stood out. Writing it down helps to further solidify these things in your heart, especially if you’re prone to distraction.'

begn , PDQ , 'Don’t avoid the Old Testament. There’s lots of treasures to be found there.'

stdy , PDQ , 'Be sure to practice good interpretation methods to avoid misunderstanding.'
stdy , PDQ , 'Pick one book of the Bible and read it over, and over, and over again. You’ll be surprised how much more you see in one book when you read it 10 times as opposed to once.'
stdy , PDQ , 'Read what Augustine, Calvin, Spurgeon, and other dead guys said about the Bible in the past to inspire you in the present.'
stdy , PDQ , 'Use a commentary. Check out this post on how to find the best commentaries.'
tech , PDQ , 'Ask a godly mentor about his or her Bible reading methods.'

tech , PDQ , 'Don’t get down on yourself if you skip a devotional time.'
tech , PDQ , 'Don’t mistake a desire to read the Bible for actually reading the Bible. Desire is great, but it doesn’t mean much if it doesn’t lead to action.'
